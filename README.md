# Electricity Demand Forecasting

A data-driven project to forecast electricity demand based on historical weather and temporal features using time series preprocessing, feature engineering and predictive modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to accurately forecast electricity demand using environmental and time-based features such as temperature, humidity and timestamps. It demonstrates preprocessing, feature creation and model training for demand prediction scenario.

## Dataset Used

**Features Included:**
- Timestamp
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Demand
- Time features: hour, dayofweek, dayofyear, weekofyear, month, quarter, is_weekend

## Data Preprocessing

- Converted `Timestamp` to `datetime` and set it as the index.
